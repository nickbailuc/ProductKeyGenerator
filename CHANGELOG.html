[DISCLAIMER]
It should be noted that this was originally meant to generate Windows 95 OEM keys,
however there is a major error in the algorithm that makes the generated keys
different enough such that they are invalid for Windows 95 activation. Furthermore,
license keys are not subject to copyright or trademarking, and this does not include
any proprietary code from Microsoft. Therefore, some bits and mentions of Microsoft
are retained in the older variants of this program.

The fundamental difference between the keys this program generates and those of Windows 95
are that at the divisible-by-7 segment (here refered to as $S3) must have a digit sum
divisible by 7, rather than a linear combination.

My goal of writing this in BASH was to solidify my knowledge of the language, and learn
more about what it can and can't do. There is nearly zero boilerplate code here!

After completing this program, I am discovering that others have implemented similar ones
in different languages (such as python 3 or PHP) in which this would be MUCH easier
as they do not have to write their own str->int interpreter like I did (where the string is
a mix of numbers and characters). The other programs are also much more basic, not offering
any arguments and only generating a single key at a time. BASH can't even handle float's
but at least its integer size is 128-bit, the equivalent of long long in C. These limitations
made the program very informative to write. Professor Lethbridge has sanctioned me to submit
assignment 5 written in BASH during the July 9 Tutorial.

Please read this changelog for better understanding the architecture without having to interpret
the different bits of code individually. It is unusually detailed, many times explaining not only
the changes I made, but also why!

	[Changes]

0.20
	-First documented version. It was able to generate only OEM keys with number of keys as argument
	-UNIX style arguments (for instance; -d for debug, -s for silent)
	-Had a basic system of exit codes

0.21
	-Implemented -d for debug and -s for silent mode as argument options for the #main script

0.30
	-Turned #main script into main() function, essentially turning this entirely into function oriented
	-Created initialization of arguments as variables (nessesary for functions to have access to them)

0.31
	-Removed init() function, instead requiring each operation to initialize itself
	-Shrunk main() function for efficiency
	-Changed the order with which main() handles arguments

0.32
	-Errors are now directed to stderr instead of stdout
	-Removed BASH variable caller "$" where unnessesary
	-Added GNU style arguments (for instance; --debug for debug mode)

0.40
	-Added help() function with a full blown manual
	-Added license() function to display license at runtime
	-Removed generate_debug() as it's become too difficult to maintain (no worries, it will come back)
	-Renamed generate() to win95oem()
	-Added abstract functions w95cd(), wntoem(), and wntcd()
	-Added Java style toString() function
	-Added SPDX-License-Identifier for automated identification of license (GPL3+)

0.41
	-MAJOR reimplementation of first and second segments of OEM key generation
	-Fixed major bug disallowing the previous verson to run at all
	-Implemented caller for validation of keys in main()
	-Intoduced exit code for "Invalid argument: product type"
	-main() now calls the appropriate function directly based on the first argument

0.42
	-Removed old deprecated code (for the first and second segments of OEM)
	-Renamed w95oem() to oem() and w95cd() to cd()
	-Removed main() handling of wntoem and wntcd as they are identical to the w95 counterparts
	-Added abstract function cd() (not etirely abstract, it does a loop for testing purposes)

0.43
	-Finally implemented the cd() generating function, allowing for generation of all types of keys
	-Modified help()'s list of examples to be more helpful

0.44
	-Moved help() below the payload of the script
	-Reimplemented debug mode for OEM only as oem_debug()

0.45
	-Implemented brand new cd_debug() in the style of oem_debug()
	-Modernized oem_debug() to fit the current more efficient version of oem()
	-Multiple detailed improvements of main()
	-Expanded on end-of-script-error adding details and email for bug reports
	-Heavy use of "\t" in strings, to make the output easier to interpret

0.46
	-Corrected SPDX license identifier
	-Added validate_oem() and validate_cd() abstract functions for
		Uses the same algorithms as oem() and cd() but reverse engineered to validate
		whether or not keys are correct
	-Changed formatting options for displaying text in bold (has not been updated since v0.20)

0.50
	-Added Copyright mention to license()
	-Added exit codes and appropriate placement of:
		exit code 4 : Validator: invalid format
		exit code 5 : Validator: invalid Key
		exit code 6 : Internal check failed!
	-Introduced global variable $KEY for convenient access by all functions
		Global variables in BASH are quite common, and do not have the stigma they do in
		other languages
	-toString() now handles displaying and formatting of $KEY

0.51
	-Newlines "\n" are now handled by printf in toString() rather than individually
	-Added "-v" and "--validate" as arguments
	-Implemented version numbering by the $VERSION variable
	-Partially restructured main()
	-help() is now displayed when no arguments are given

0.52
	-Introduced new usage() function, displaying a short synopsis
	-usage() is displayed instead of help()
	-Added some elements of internal checking algorithm

0.53
	-Introduced check_oem() abstract function
		validate_oem() checks whether a user inputed a valid key whereas
		check_oem() would check whether the program is making internal errors during oem() key generation
	-Implemented efficient error handling by validate_cd()
	-Fixed bugs where check_cd() was trying to access variables that do not exist or were renamed
	-Added $REPORT variable, which displays info on reporting bugs when they occur, instead of
	 just displaying the appropriate error message

0.54
	-Using DeMorgen law, many test conditions are now simplified
	-check_cd() completely removed as it will require a rewrite from scratch

0.60
	-New implementation of check_cd() with efficiency in mind
	-validate_oem() and validate_cd() now test if certain segments are integers where they need to be
	-Temporarily implemented a horrible inefficient way of solving the DECIMAL PROBLEM
		BASH interprets numbers like 076 as octal numbers, not decimal. There is a way to force
		decimal interpretation, however it is not suited for my program as it requires that strings
		entirely consist digits, not a mix of digits and other characters
	-Suppressed irrelevant output of internal BASH functions (specifically if statements)
	-More "\t" handling outsourced to toString()

0.61
	-Removed some debugging code (not part of the debug functions) that was used for testing
	-Reimplemented mathematical validation section of check_cd()

0.62
	-IMPLEMENTED validate_oem() AND check_oem() FOR THE FIRST TIME
	-Rewrote integer testing with the help of DeMorgan law
	-Added many #TODO statements where appropriate for future repairs
	-Added bold text to error output where it's needed

0.70
	-Added $EMAIL variable making it easier to change report-to email (only has to be changed in 1 place)
	-Added dead code explaining what functions do
	-Removed old code which was not being used
	-Changed the way validate_oem() and validate_cd() test for correct format
	-Changed the way validate_oem() and validate_cd() display format errors
	-Reinstated validation of $S2 segment in check_oem()
	-Initialization now happens before Format validation in validate_cd() (reducing unhandled errors)
	-check_cd() now has more efficient mathematical validation
	-toString() now interacts with validate_oem() and validate_cd()
	-Multiple miscellaneous fixes to printable strings throughout the entire script

0.80
	-Forked this project creating a new "uOttawa" compliant version
	-Modified all string lines to not be longer than 80 characters
	-Removed ALL textual mentions of Microsoft and their products
	-Changed email from personal to uottawa
	-Updated help(), usage(), and license()

0.81
	-Got rid of the underline of key output in debug mode
	-Changed consistency of validate_oem() and validate_cd() stderr at invalid format
	-Changed how validate_oem(), validate_cd(), check_oem(), and check_cd() obtain value $g
	-Modified $REPORT string
	-Listed changing while to for loops in main() as TODO's
	-Introduced new C style zero_remover() function:
		-Used for forcing decimal interpretation of integers
		-Includes $DEC variable (input & output of function)
		-Also includes $LENDEC variable (required for static length of $DEC before it is changed)
	-EXPERIMENTALLY Implemented zero_remover() in check_cd()

0.82
	-FINALLY SOLVED THE DECIMAL PROBLEM IN ERROR CHECKING FUNCTIONS, PRESENT SINCE v0.50 and
	 partially solved with a horrible method in v0.60	
	-POSIX-COMPLIANCY: Replaced $(expr length $VAR) with ${#VAR} in validate_oem() and validate_cd()
		This officially means the script no longer relies on GNU coreutils and should
		run on MacOS and other POSIX-compliant systems that have BASH
	-Removed deprecated code from check_cd()
	-Implemented zero_remover() in validate_oem(), check_oem(), and validate_cd()
	-Removed Format Validation from check_oem() and check_cd() making them 7.56 times as efficient!
